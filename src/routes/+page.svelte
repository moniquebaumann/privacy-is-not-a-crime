    <h1>Privacy Is Not A Crime</h1>

    We end government crime.
    <p></p>
    We separate money from state criminals, like religion has been separated from
    state criminals.
    <p></p>
    We showcase how people can define for themselves what they accept as money for
    peer to peer interactions.

    <h2>History</h2>
    International socialists and their young global cheaters from the WEF et al.
    went too far in exploiting us.
    <p></p>
    They raised taxes for nonsense, they inflated their shitcoins like USD, EUR etc.
    which they had forced upon us.
    <p></p>
    They provoked wars. They murdered hundreds of thousands of men.
    <p></p>
    They criminalized freedom people and sent them to jail. If you do not know many
    examples yourself, you are an idiot yourself.
    <p></p>
    They laundered their money through corrupt government officials, through corrupt
    so called defense organizations and through the weapons- and media industry in
    general.
    <p></p>
    They manipulated people via mass surveillance. They manipulated people via their
    mobile devices and radiation. They provoked plandemics to manipulate people

    have hidden thousands of paperwallets in thousands of restrooms all around the
    globe. Some of those hideouts are documented

    We combine crypto education and reasonable distribution of

    with Geo-Caching.
    <p></p>
    Once the initial distribution is completed we will donate Matic and ETH liquidity
    to get the party started.
