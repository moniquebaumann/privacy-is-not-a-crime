    <h1>Privacy Is Not A Crime</h1>
    <p><br /></p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>

    We end government crime.
    <p></p>
    We separate money from state criminals like religion has been separated from
    state.
    <p></p>
    We showcase how people can define for themselves what they accept as money for
    peer to peer interactions.
    <p><br /></p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    International socialists and their young global cheaters from the WEF et al.
    went too far in exploiting us.
    <p></p>
    They raised taxes for nonsense, they inflated their shitcoins like USD, EUR etc.
    which they had forced upon us.
    <p></p>
    They provoked wars. They murdered hundreds of thousands of men.
    <p></p>
    They criminalized freedom people and sent them to jail. If you do not know many
    examples yourself, you are an idiot yourself.
    <p></p>
    They laundered their money through corrupt government officials, through corrupt
    so called defense organizations and through the weapons- and media industry in
    general.
    <p></p>
    They manipulated people via mass surveillance. They manipulated people via their
    mobile devices and radiation. They provoked plandemics to manipulate people

        href="https://github.com/moniquebaumann/friends-of-satoshi"
        target="_blank">friends of satoshi</a
    >
    have hidden thousands of paperwallets in thousands of restrooms all around the
    globe. Some of those hideouts are documented
    <a href="https://rumble.com/c/c-6145166" target="_blank">on video</a>.
    <p></p>
    We combine crypto education and reasonable distribution of

    with Geo-Caching.
    <p></p>
    Once the initial distribution is completed we will donate Matic and ETH liquidity
    to get the party started.
